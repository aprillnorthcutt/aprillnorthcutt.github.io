# Application Rationalization & Modernization Program  
95+ legacy systems • Unknown dependencies • Cloud modernization enabler

**Role:** Program Lead (Delivery + Engineering Leadership)  
**Goal:** Reduce technical debt, clarify ownership, and unlock modernization by retiring or consolidating legacy applications and artifacts.

---

## Problem

- 95+ legacy applications, shared artifacts, and databases with **unknown ownership and dependency chains**
- Multiple systems performing overlapping functions, increasing cost and operational risk
- Lack of visibility into what could be retired, rewritten, or modernized

> The organization was unable to move forward with modernization because nobody knew what was safe to retire.

---

## Approach

1. **Inventory & discovery**  
   - Identified every application, database, SSRS report, shared job, interface queue, and cron/process.
   - Created application dependency mapping and ownership model.

2. **Retirement decision framework**  
   - Defined criteria for *Retire / Replace / Modernize / Keep*, aligned with Product + Architecture + Exec sponsors.

3. **Execution + change management**  
   - Sequenced system retirements to avoid production impact.
   - Communicated decisions and progress visually (heatmaps, scorecards).

## Outcomes

- Retired or consolidated **95+ legacy applications and artifacts**
- Reduced operational overhead, licensing costs, and on-call burden
- Eliminated redundant systems that slowed modernization
- Cleared the path for cloud migration (Azure)

> Result: For the first time, leadership had a definitive map of the application portfolio and a path to retire dead weight.

---

## What I Led

- Cross-functional alignment with Product, Architecture, Engineering, and Support
- Designed the dependency mapping process and decision framework
- Created visibility into risks, blockers, and ownership
- Facilitated sequencing and execution to avoid production impact

## Before vs. After

| Before (Chaos) | After (Clarity + Impact) |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Unknown ownership | Application owners identified |
| Redundancy & duplication | Consolidation roadmap |
| No retirement criteria | `Retire / Replace / Modernize / Keep` framework |
| Blocked modernization | Cloud migration enabled |
