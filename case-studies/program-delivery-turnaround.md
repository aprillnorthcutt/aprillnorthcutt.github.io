# Program Delivery Alignment & Turnaround

**Role:** Engagement Owner / Delivery Leader  
**Goal:** Restore stakeholder confidence and return programs to predictable delivery.

## Problem
- Multi-team initiatives slipping timelines; unclear ownership and blocked dependencies.
- Escalations increasing; confidence declining.

## Approach
- Re-established ownership, roles, and communication rhythms.
- Implemented risk/dependency registers with visible SLAs and unblock paths.
- Introduced blameless postmortems and measurable improvement goals.

## Execution Rhythm (sample)
<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
participant Exec as Exec Sponsor
participant PM as Delivery
participant Eng as Engineering
Exec->>PM: Outcomes & Priorities
PM->>Eng: Plan, Risks, Dependencies
Eng-->>PM: Status, Blockers, Forecast
PM-->>Exec: Progress, Decisions Needed
</div>

---

## Outcomes
- Consistent on-time delivery restored across affected programs.
- Fewer escalations; improved signal-to-noise in status reporting.
- Higher stakeholder confidence and clearer decision-making.

## What I Led
- Stakeholder alignment (exec to IC) and decision facilitation.
- Cadence design (planning, demos, risk reviews, release readiness).
- Hands-on unblock work when needed to protect delivery dates.
